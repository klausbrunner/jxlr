\title{jxlr: JPEG XL Image Format Support for R}
\description{
Provides functions to read, write, and manipulate JPEG XL (JXL) image files in R. JPEG XL is a modern image format that offers superior compression efficiency and quality compared to traditional formats while maintaining compatibility with existing workflows. Supports both lossy and lossless compression modes, RGB and RGBA images, and follows the same conventions as the 'png' and 'jpeg' packages.
