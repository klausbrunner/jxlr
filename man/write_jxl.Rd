\title{Write JPEG XL images}
\usage{
write_jxl(image, target = NULL, quality = 90, effort = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{3D array (width x height x channels) with values in \[0,1\].
Must have 3 (RGB) or 4 (RGBA) channels.}

\item{target}{Output file path, or \code{NULL} to return raw vector}

\item{quality}{Compression quality: 0-100 for lossy, \code{NA} for lossless}

\item{effort}{Compression effort: 1-9 (1=fastest, 9=best compression, default=7)}
}
\value{
If \code{target} is \code{NULL}, returns raw vector with class "jxl".
Otherwise, invisibly returns the file path.
}
\description{
Write image arrays to JPEG XL format with configurable quality settings.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
img <- array(runif(8 * 8 * 3), dim = c(8, 8, 3))

jxl_best <- write_jxl(img, quality = 85, effort = 9)
